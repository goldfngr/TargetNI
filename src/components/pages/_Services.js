          <h3>TNI has a broad range of service offerings for our Value Added Reseller partners/customers to utilize. But first we start with developing the initial solution development plan.   Then we work closely with our Value Added Reseller partners to develop a “Statement Of Work” SOW and then when the end user customer agrees to the plan we develop a timetable of events.  After completion of the project we review and survey the end customer and VAR partner to determine satisfaction level.</h3>
